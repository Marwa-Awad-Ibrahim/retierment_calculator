The inputs:
1-Age you want to retire
2-Your Age
3-Current year

The outputs:

2- the year you can retire

The process:
1- calculate the birthyear (Current year-Age)
2- calculate retirement year (retire age + birthyear)
3- calculate years left (retirement year - current year)

The Constrains:
1-retirement year can not be smaller the current year
2- age can not be empty or negative
